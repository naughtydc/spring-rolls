> **Chocolate Chip Cookies**

 This is an example of a simple chocolate chip cookie recipe. A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie that features chocolate chips or chocolate morsels as its distinguishing ingredient. Chocolate chip cookies originated in the United States around 1938, when Ruth Graves Wakefield chopped up a Nestl√© semi-sweet chocolate bar and added the chopped chocolate to a cookie recipe.
 Chocolate chips or chocolate morsels are small chunks of sweetened chocolate, used as an ingredient in a number of desserts (notably chocolate chip cookies and muffins), in trail mix and less commonly in some breakfast foods such as pancakes.
